# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
I’d like to create an app for users to track their daily exercises, while working out at home. Gyms and fitness centers have closed due to the Covid-19 virus, so it has become harder for some people to continue (or start) their fitness journey. However, there are other ways to stay active while on lockdown. With this app, users will be allowed to log their exercises from home and build workout routines. If you’re anything like me, working out at home can be distracting at times, so to make the workouts more engaging, users will win points (called "Gains") for completing timed workout routines. Also, the app will have a Community page that will display other users’ Gains, as motivation to raise one’s “score”.

As exercise improves mental health, I hope that this app will help reduce stress in users, while staying safe at home.

### Features
* User login: Users will be able to create an account and log in to the application.
* Gain Points: Users will be allowed to select a time limit for their workout and will be awarded a certain amount of points based on the time they chose. Points gained will be saved to their account.
* Track Workout: Users will be able to enter exercises of their choosing into a daily log, and save workout routines. 
* Community Point Ranking: Users will be able to see a ranking of points from other users, from highest to lowest.

### Technologies
So far...
* Javascript
* HTML
* CSS
* MySQL

### What I'll Have to Learn
I want users to be able to choose from a list of exercises (with tutorials for each exercise), so I would need to access the API to a fitness website. Also, I want to rank app users’ points from highest to lowest. I’m not sure yet which technologies will help me achieve this, but I’m determined to find out!
